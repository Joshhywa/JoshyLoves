<font size="3" color="1D2951" face="Arial"><b>Preacher's Daughter is the debut studio album for American singer-songwriter Ethel Cain, released on May 12, 2022, through her own label, Daughters of Cain Records. It is a concept album that draws on the artist's personal life as the daughter of a deacon, but creates a narrative "centered around the character Ethel Cain, who runs away from home only to meet a gruesome end at the hands of a cannibalistic psychopath." Upon release, the album received universal acclaim from music critics, who lauded the production, storytelling, cohesiveness, and Cain's songwriting. The album has since gained a cult following.<br>
<p align="justify">
Preacher's Daughter is a slowcore, Americana, folk, ethereal, and goth-pop, album with influences from dark ambient, heartland rock, classic rock, cock rock, sludge, gospel, industrial, noise, horror-electronica, country and drone.<br>
<p align="justify">
Preacher's Daughter documents the life of Ethel and her relationship with a lover. Personally at first listen this was one of those albums I felt extremely overwhelmed with - considering the production is guitar and noise heavy. But as the more I listened to it and as I listen intently with the lyrics I just can't help but faill in love with the album. My current number 1 most listened to - I can't help but just romanticize my little small town rural life just like how Ethel lived hers. And yes the themes being sung are very heavy - the story telling aspect haunting and stressful but to me this is simply the charm of the composition, who knew a song about being cannibalized could be so good??? Not me baby I did not expect that at all oh at AWWLLLLLL.<br>

<font size="3" color="1D2951" face="Arial"><b>Ctrl (pronounced "control") is the debut studio album by American singer SZA. It was released through Top Dawg Entertainment and RCA Records on June 9, 2017.The album features guest appearances from Travis Scott, Kendrick Lamar, James Fauntleroy, and Isaiah Rashad. Production was handled by Craig Balmoris, Frank Dukes, Carter Lang, Scum, and ThankGod4Cody, among others. The album was supported by five singles: "Drew Barrymore", "Love Galore", "The Weekend", "Broken Clocks", and "Garden (Say It like Dat)", all of which are certified Platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Upon release, Ctrl received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production, as well as SZA's vocal delivery. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, moving 60,000 equivalent-album units in its first week. The album and its songs were nominated for four Grammy Awards, while SZA was nominated for Best New Artist. It was also included in several year-end best music lists by publications. The album was ranked at 472 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.<br>
<p align="justify">
In an album of self-discovery, SZA preaches on the themes of body image and insecurity, femininity, and love. This album is heavy on questioning the societal norms that are placed upon women. The necessity to remain perfect at all times, being complacent or submissive in toxic relationships, and remaining sexually monogamous are all questioned in this come-to-earth album by SZA. The primordial struggle of being a woman is the strife SZA explores in CTRL. Upon advice from her mother and grandmother throughout the album, she is encouraged to seize control of her life — to put matters into her own hands. The necessity of making your story your own is vital, especially as a woman.<br>
<p align="justify">
I was honestly a little late when I finally listened to the album back in 2019 during the early stages of my college journey. This album had been my confidant in sailing the uncertain harsh waters of falling in love - being the way that I am. I cannot count how many times I have cried to specific tracks on the album back then and how healing it felt to do so. Now even when SOS came out I still think this album is her one true Magnum Opus. This album is almost like a time capsule to me - as evrytime I listen to it, I just can't help but smile thinking about why it hurts. It's funny sometimes that even I just have to laugh how pain before can be so insignificant compared to the pain in the present.<br>

<font size="3" color="1D2951" face="Arial"><b>Red Velvet (Korean: 레드벨벳; RR: Redeubelbet) is a South Korean girl group formed and managed by SM Entertainment. They originally debuted on August 1, 2014, with the single "Happiness" with the four-member line-up of Irene, Seulgi, Wendy and Joy. A fifth member, Yeri, joined in March 2015, following the release of their first extended play, Ice Cream Cake. Sonically, the music of Red Velvet reflects their group name: their predominantly-pop "red" side experiments occasionally with electronic and funk, while their "velvet" side focuses on '90s-influenced R&B with elements of ballad and hip hop. Their genre versatility and catchy hooks have garnered critical praise.<br>
<p align="justify">
Perfect Velvet is the second studio album by South Korean girl group Red Velvet. Released by SM Entertainment on November 17, 2017, the record incorporates R&B, soul and hip-hop with influences from future bass, trap and synth-pop, and saw contributions from various songwriters and production teams. The album is a portrayal of the group's "velvet" concept, making it their second major release to follow this sonic direction since their second extended play, The Velvet (2016). The album reissued as The Perfect Red Velvet on January 29, 2018.Perfect Velvet was included in several year-end lists from critics and earned the group several nominations, including Best Pop Album at Korean Music Awards and Album of the Year at the 2018 Mnet Asian Music Awards. A landmark performance by the group was held in North Korea where they performed "Bad Boy" at the "Spring is Coming" concert, to an audience that included Kim Jong-un.<br>
<p align="justify">
WHEN I SAY THE GREATEST KPOP GROUP ALIVE YOU BEST BELIEVE IT!!!!!! Where do I even start with this album - hell the group and it's members are what makes the album. I have been a Kpop fan for the longest time now and nothing comes close to Red Velvet's charm and pristine discography. Often labeled as "The Critic's Favorite" for always releasing top notch music! If someone you know who thinks rigidly of what Kpop music is then you better plug that phone in some speakers and have this album BLASTING through the sound sytem!!!<br>

<p align="justify">
<font size="3" color="1D2951" face="Arial"><b>Melodrama is the second studio album by New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde. It was released on 16 June 2017 by Lava and Republic Records and distributed through Universal. Following the breakthrough success of her debut album Pure Heroine (2013), Lorde retreated from the spotlight, and travelled between New Zealand and the United States. Initially inspired by her disillusionment with fame, she wrote Melodrama to capture heartbreak and solitude after her first breakup.<br>
<p align="justify">
According to The New York Times, Melodrama is about a "grapple with emotions" in the aftermath of a break-up. Interviewed by the publication, Lorde says Melodrama is not simply a "breakup album" but is rather a "record about being alone", featuring both the favourable and unfavourable aspects associated with "heartbreak and solitude". She did, however, call "Green Light" a traditional break-up song. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Lorde said the title of the album is a "nod to the types of emotions you experience when you're 19 or 20." She cites her "love of theater" and drawing parallels to Greek tragedies as inspiration for the album's title. According to Lorde, she had to deal with "very serious, vivid feelings" she needed to express after experiencing her first heartbreak and moving out of her parents' home; as a result, she spent time isolated in her own house.<br>
<p align="justify">
The Album is loosely a concept album taking place at a single house party, with the singer recently discussing with the New York Times the range of emotions that tend to come with them: "There’s that moment where a great song comes on and you’re ecstatic, and then there’s that moment later on where you’re alone in the bathroom, looking in the mirror, you don’t think you look good, and you start feeling horrible."<br>
<p align="justify">
It was nearly very different however, with Lorde telling NME that the original idea positioned it 'from the perspective of aliens stepping out of a hermetically-sealed environment for the first time, linking the concept to her own disorientating experiences with fame.' Though she ultimately ditched the "aliens step out of their bubble" idea, her fascination with a Ray Bradbury sci-fi short story, There Will Come Soft Rains, stayed. “It’s about this self-operating house and how it continues to run every day after some sort of nuclear event,” Lorde told NME.<br>
<p align="justify">
“I was very aware of the fact that we were just holing up in my house, drinking and making a concerted effort to block out the rest of the world, as if there’d been some sort of nuclear fallout. When there’ve been two years that have been so turbulent and traumatic, and the climate is so tangible when you walk outside… There was definitely an element of, ‘If we just make our own little universe inside and no one looks at their phones, then none of it’s really happening.'"

<font size="3" color="1D2951" face="Arial"><b>Ungodly Hour is the second studio album by American R&B duo Chloe x Halle. It was released through Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records on June 12, 2020. Originally scheduled for June 5, the album's release was delayed as a gesture of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and the global protests following the murder of George Floyd. The album was supported by the singles "Do It", "Catch Up", and "Forgive Me", the former of which became their most successful song to date. A reissue of the album "Chrome Edition" was released on February 26, 2021. Upon release, Ungodly Hour received widespread acclaim from music critics, with many praising the album's cohesiveness and the duo's vocal delivery, artistic growth and maturity. It also featured on various year-end lists and received a nomination for Best Progressive R&B Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, along with nominations for Best Traditional R&B Performance for "Wonder What She Thinks of Me", and Best R&B Song for "Do It". The album debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200 chart with 24,000 album-equivalent units, marking the duo's highest-charting album.<br>
<p align="justify">
Most of the tracks on Ungodly Hour are about "navigating messy situations — sometimes ones that you have caused."The concept of the album has a constant message of being completely unapologetic about one's true self. The thirty-second album opener "Intro" contains the lyric "Don't ever ask for permission, ask for forgiveness", before immediately leading into the track "Forgive Me". This song in particular pushes the aforementioned message, and also drives a "sorry, not sorry" attitude while giving "a proverbial middle finger up to the lovers they've spurned". The track "Baby Girl" was noted by critics for its female empowerment elements and for "reconciling the vulnerability of womanhood with the angst of their younger, more impressionable selves."<br>
<p align="justify">
In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music on BBC Radio 1, Chloe said that the duo "really just wanted to show how we could pair [their] musicianship with a few bops and letting people enjoy themselves." The duo developed the title Ungodly Hour while writing the lead single "Do It". Halle revealed that they gave the record this name because "it's okay to not be perfect all the time. We wanted to challenge the idea of us being these perfect angels that everybody has this image of us in their head." In another interview with NPR, Halle also said she felt that "during [the 'ungodly hour'], there can be a lot of things going on through your head" and that a person may think of all the insecurities or ups and downs they may have in life, hence why in the title track they sing the lyric: "When you decide you like yourself, and you need someone in your life, love me at the ungodly hour. Love me at my best and my worst."<br>
